Briefly discuss your results in a separate text file. Are they what you expect? What accounts for the disparity in time elapsed for the different solutions?


I am getting the highest time in Left-handed solution because it's giving priority to left handed philosopher to eat first and then other philosophers. 
So other philosophers are thinking while left handed one is eating. So it may go into starvation problem. 


In Footman solution, one by one gets a chance to eat. The philosoher thinks indefinitely and every eating philosopher ends eating eventually, giving way for 
other philosophers to eat. So that is why it takes time to complete it.


And at last, Tanenbaum Solution checks whether left or right philosopher is eating or not. If they are not then that philosopher gets the fork and 
this way it takes less time to complete. Tanenbaum's solution avoids deadlock, by always avoiding one philosopher from trying the lock, to make sure that 
atleast one of the others will get chance to eat. However, it might lead to one philosopher never getting a chance to eat at all.
